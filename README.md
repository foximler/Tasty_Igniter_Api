# Tasty_Igniter_Api
An opensource flask api meant to help apps communicate with a TastyIgniter install. A work of progress, part of #Devember

How to install:
add the following column to your tasty igniter database:
"order_printed" INT
after that you will need to run the initial setup script to create the root user.
